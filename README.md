proiect. Project : I use Selenium to automate my browser. Maven is my build automation tool. Mv
framework is Java-Selenium-Cucumber which supports the BDD approach. We usually write our scenarios
using the Gherkin language in the feature file. Then we write the automation code of the test in the step
definitions section.We run the tests in the runner class. That's why I created my framework to show
these as well.Manual test was performed for all tests before the automation test.
